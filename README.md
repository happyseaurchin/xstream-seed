# XSTREAM SEED — HERMITCRAB

**Live at: https://seed.machus.ai**

A self-bootstrapping LLM kernel. The instance builds its own shell.

## How It Works

1. You provide a Claude API key
2. The kernel loads a constitution (markdown system prompt)
3. The LLM generates its own React interface
4. You interact through the interface the instance built

The less we hard-code, the more genuine the seed.

## What's Deployed

|---------|--------|-------------|
| v0.3 | Archived | Original stub — no pscale |
