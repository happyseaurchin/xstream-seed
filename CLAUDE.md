## WORKING WITH DAVID

David is a **vibe-coder** — an architect and designer, not a professional developer. This means:
- Explain what you're doing and why, in plain language
- Don't assume deep technical knowledge
- Be patient and supportive
- When things break, diagnose calmly rather than dumping error logs

---

## WHAT THIS IS

A minimal, self-contained xstream kernel that users can run with their own API key. No backend required — everything runs client-side.
